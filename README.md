# pacmen-MIT-xPRO-excercise

The Pacman Excercise 

In this excercise we practice our DOM manipulation technique.

We were tasked to create a website that would summon Pacmens by clicking "Add Pacman" button.

Then all created Pacmen would starting bouncing on the page when "Start Game" is clicked.

Roadmap or future improvements:
There is alot I need to improve here.

First I would need to figure out how to make the pacmen face backwards when hitting a wall. 

Secondly I need to figure out how to make its mouth close and open.
